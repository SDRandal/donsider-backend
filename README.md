# Donsider Backend
This backend will need to be paired with a local mongo database setup to listen on port 27017(i believe this is the default)

Another caveat is that I used AWS S3 buckets with Cloudfront to help with resources, and that config file was excluded to protect the keys that I have setup for my local instance of the application.
